On 8 September 2022, at 15:10 BST, Elizabeth II, Queen of the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms, and the longest-reigning British monarch, died of old age at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, at the age of 96.
The Queen's death was publicly announced at 18:30.
She was succeeded by her eldest child, Charles III.

The death of the Queen set in motion Operation London Bridge, a collection of plans including arrangements for her state funeral, and supported by Operation Unicorn, which set protocols for her death occurring in Scotland.
The United Kingdom observed a national mourning period of 10 days.
The Queen's lying in state took place in Westminster Hall from 14 to 19 September, during which time an estimated 250,000 people queued to pay their respects.

The state funeral service was held at Westminster Abbey on 19 September, followed on the same day by a committal service at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle.
The Queen was interred with her husband Philip in the King George VI Memorial Chapel later that evening.
The occasion of her state funeral was a public holiday in the UK and several Commonwealth states.
The state funeral was one of the United Kingdom's most watched special television broadcasts, surpassing the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the previous most watched royal event of the 21st century.
